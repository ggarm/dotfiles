# This is a clean-room implementation of the Fish shell's history search
# feature, where you can enter any part of any previous command and press
# the UP and DOWN arrow keys to cycle through all matching commands.
#
# This was originally implemented by Peter Stephenson[1], who published it to
# the ZSH users mailing list (thereby making it public domain) in September
# 2009.  It was later revised revised by Guido van Steen, who released it
# under the BSD license as part of the fizsh[2] project in January 2011.
#
# It was later extracted from fizsh[2], repackaged as both an oh-my-zsh[3]
# plugin and as an independently sourceable ZSH script, and published as
# zsh-history-substring-search[4] by Suraj N. Kurapati in January 2011.
